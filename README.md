# Pluralsight Course: EF Core 2: GettingStarted
Sample code for my "EF Core 2: Getting Started" course released Feb 2018

This is the source code for Pluralsight course EF Core 2: Getting Started. I have updated all of the projects to use  EF Core 2.1.

Most of these changes are just package ref changes in the csproj files. The only code change I made is in the Module 3 after and Module 4 after, program.cs, where there is a new method to demonstrate a change to batching in EF COre 2.1. By default, batching is only used when there are 4 or more commands to send to the database.

You can watch the course at: http://bit.ly/2oBvekc.
